# Image Classification with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and MLPs  

## Overview  
This project focuses on implementing neural networks to classify images as either AI-generated or real. By exploring **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**, we leverage their capabilities to tackle this intriguing image classification task. The work is based on the CIFAKE dataset and combines practical implementation with theoretical insights.  

This project was developed as part of the **Neural Networks class** with **Dr. Marwa Reda**.

## Dataset  
We used the [CIFAKE dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images), which is structured as follows:  
- **train**: Contains `REAL` and `FAKE` subdirectories for training data.  
- **test**: Contains `REAL` and `FAKE` subdirectories for evaluation.  

The dataset was accessed using Google Colab and the Kaggle API.  

## Objectives  
1. Implement neural network models for image classification.  
2. Explore the effectiveness of KAN and MLP architectures.  
3. Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.  

## Key Features  
- Structured dataset handling (`train` and `test` folders).  
- Implementation of KAN and MLP architectures.  
- Analysis and performance evaluation of neural network models.  

## Implementation  
The implementation focuses on simplifying the architecture while enabling experimentation with KAN and MLP models. The project is inspired by the paper [arXiv:2408.09371](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09371).
